Booze Blog is a place where alcohol meets analysis. It's a blog that looks into the typographic and design choices behind some of the most renowned alcohol brands in the UK. 

When deciding what subject matter to write about, I was inspired by my time in the first national lockdown when I painted a large composition consisting of 16 alcohol logos. Due to the amount of time I spent researching which logos to paint, I became very familiar with the various brands and logos. Not to mention the fact I am a university student, which is indeed an alcohol focused lifestyle.

For the original design of this blog, I initially constructed an alcohol themed logo, favicon and banner image using Adobe Illustrator. Unfortunately, after having written a few blog posts I realised the theme I was conveying with them did not suit the blog design anymore. I was aiming for a sleek and sophisticated theme for my blog; however, the original design was more on the fun side, it had a juvenile essence. So, I reimagined the previous design to created a simpler version which is more flexible.

## **The Logo**

For the logo, I decided to make it bold
